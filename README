# Setup

- deploy new instance of the contract.sol
- update contract address in script.jsx
- serve the files (for example with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9092`)
- open Mist browser and open the page inside it
- share an identity (account) with this Dapp (upper right corner in Mist) // note: app could as well ask for it when sending tx, but this seems to be broken in some cases
- done, now send some messages
